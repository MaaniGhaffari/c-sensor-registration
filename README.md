# c-sensor-registration

This repository contains examples of sensor registration using different manifolds and Lie groups. For the RGB-D visual odometry case, i.e., R^3 and SE(3), see:

**Continuous sensor registration** is a new mathematical framework that enables nonparametric joint semantic/appearance and geometric representation of continuous functions using data. The joint semantic and geometric embedding is modeled by representing the processes in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. The framework allows the functions to be defined on arbitrary smooth manifolds where the action of a Lie group is used to align them. The continuous functions allow the registration to be independent of a specific signal resolution and the framework is fully analytical with a closed-form derivation of the Riemannian gradient and Hessian.
